# ECOMMERCE SERVER : OVERVIEW

I was fascinated that I created my own server that runs like the live server extension of vscode. With this custom activity that I made, I apply my knowledge with HTML Templating as well as making Route Handlers and some basic stuffs like advance array methods and POJO manipulation. I was also introduce with new packages namely http and fs modules.

1. Create a server directory
2. Inside the server folder, create 2 folders
    - assets                                    <= this is where css or image files will be stored
    - views                                     <= this is where html documents will be stored
3. Create a file server.js
4. cd into the server directory
5. npm init -y                                  <= creates package.json
6. Import modules
    - const http = require('http');             <= Creates a server
    - const fs = require('fs');                 <= Reads a file and convert it into string
